## Screenshots

The current visual direction uses a near-black canvas, artwork-led atmosphere, restrained glass surfaces, compact playback controls, and a persistent mini-player above the navigation bar. Each screen is shown at full width so the complete phone layout remains readable.

## Features

### Playback and library

- Android Media3 background playback and media controls.
- Queue management, seeking, repeat, playback speed, downloads, and sleep timer.
- Local files, downloaded music, cached playback, playlists, artists, albums, and liked songs.
- Artwork metadata for notifications, system media controls, and the mini-player.

### FrostSoulX player experience

- Vinyl-inspired and immersive artwork-driven player presentations.
- Seamless artwork atmosphere for player, recommendation, and lyric contexts.
- Compact mini-player docked above the bottom navigation with quick playback actions.
- Album, artist, playlist, and recommendation screens designed around readable hierarchy and artwork prominence.

### Lyrics and discovery

- Synchronized lyrics with timing offset, refresh, translation, and artist navigation.
- Home discovery, contextual recommendations, search, album pages, artist profiles, and playlists.
- Listening history and context-aware sections such as Featured for You, Continue Listening, and For This Moment.
- Artwork palette extraction for player backgrounds and ambient visual treatment.

### Audio

- Media3 audio processing with a low-latency immersive path.
- Steam Audio integration is available as an experimental feature and may produce distorted or clipped sound on some devices.
- The immersive audio OFF state preserves the original playback path and bypasses the experimental processor.
- The experimental path uses a 384-frame processing quantum and exposes development diagnostics for tuning.
